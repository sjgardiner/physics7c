# Wave Graph Problem Generator

This is a simple web app that I developed to help students taking Physics 7C at UC Davis. A standard problem on the exams
for this class asks the student to inspect a set of two plots that represent a one-dimensional wave. Based on the plots, the
student is expected to write down an equation that describes the wave at all times and places. The student must also explain
how she arrived at the final form of her equation using visual evidence from the plots.

Students often have trouble connecting equations with plots in Physics 7. To make matters worse, the standard homework assignments
for Physics 7C contain only two opportunities for the students to practice this kind of problem. As a result, students who initially
struggle are often left without further examples to build their understanding. For the TA who desires to help, creating new 1D wave
problems on-the-fly can be a tricky business. If one isn't careful, it's easy to draw a set of plots that are ambiguous, contradictory,
or simply too difficult.

This web app automates the creation of new 1D wave problems, allowing the students and TAs to focus on building understanding. A live
version of the app is hosted on Red Hat's OpenShift platform at http://physics7.sgardiner.com
